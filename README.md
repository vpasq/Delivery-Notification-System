# DeliveryNotificationSystem ([UML Diagram](https://github.com/vpasq/Delivery-Notification-System/blob/master/UML_DeliveryNotificationSystem.pdf)) 

This is a Java Maven Project Template that uses the Observer Pattern.
- Delivery requests are listed in an auction 
- Delivery driver subscribers bid on delivery requests
- Initial notifications are sent out when a delivery request is created 
  informing all drivers of its auction listing
- Notifications are also sent out after each driver's bid informing
  all drivers of the current new high bid
